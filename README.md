# Registering 10DLC brands and campaigns

A revised version of the [_Wavix 10DLC guide_](https://www.wavix.com/resources/guides/10dlc).

Some notes:

- I revised the title to make it more informative.
- I restructured the article into three top-level sections:
  - _What is 10DLC?_
  - _Registering a 10DLC brand_
  - _Registering a 10DLC campaign_
- I followed the [_Microsoft Writing Style Guide_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/). In keeping with the guide, I used lowercase for brands, campaigns, sender IDs, etc.
- I used the following types of info boxes:
  - Note
  - Tip
  - Important
  - Warning
- I added external links to explain some terms.
- The procedures for registering brands and campaigns could be expanded. For example, the initial steps of each process are unclear. Normally, I would test this in the platform or ask a relevant stakeholder.
- I fact-checked the registration processes against [this guide](https://www.campaignregistry.com/Assets%2FTCR-CSP-User-Manual_Doc_V6.pdf) by TCR.
